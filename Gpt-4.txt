Thanks for the image â€” it clearly shows the official Azure pricing for GPT-4o Mini in the East US region as of April 2025.

Hereâ€™s the correct updated pricing from the image:


---

ðŸ“Œ GPT-4o Mini (o4-mini) â€“ Pay-as-you-go Pricing (per 1M tokens)

Input: $0.25 per 1M tokens

Output: $1.25 per 1M tokens

ðŸ§® Recalculating Your Hourly and Monthly Cost

âœ… Hourly Usage:

Input: 17.89M tokens Ã— $0.25 = $4.4725

Output: 10.21M tokens Ã— $1.25 = $12.7625

Total per hour = $4.4725 + $12.7625 = $17.235



---

ðŸ“… Monthly Cost (30 Days, 24/7 Usage):

$17.235/hour Ã— 24 hours/day Ã— 30 days/month
= $12,408.60 per month

Let me know if you'd like the cost with Batch API pricing (which is usually discounted) or want to model for part-time or on-demand usage instead of continuous 24/7.
