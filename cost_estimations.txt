| **Component**                                | **Cost-Effective (Monthly)**        | **Efficient (Monthly)**                   | **Reason for Cost**                                                                                              |
| -------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Cloud Logging + Export to Pub/Sub**        | \$10 (10 GB logs/month)             | \$50 (50 GB/month)                        | \$0.50/GB (basic logging); cost increases with volume and retention time                                         |
| **Pub/Sub + Dataflow / Cloud Functions**     | \$20 (batch via Cloud Function)     | \$100 (real-time Dataflow)                | Pub/Sub \~\$0.40/GB egress; Cloud Function cheaper for low-frequency batch; Dataflow is \$0.01/GB + vCPU charges |
| **Vertex AI (Model Training + Prediction)**  | \$50 (batch inference, small model) | \$150+ (real-time inference, large model) | Custom model: \$5/hour for training, \$0.10â€“\$0.20/prediction; real-time is more expensive                       |
| **BigQuery (Storage + Queries)**             | \$20 (10 GB, 100 queries)           | \$100 (50+ GB, frequent queries)          | \$0.02/GB stored/month + \$5/TB queried; efficient mode queries more often                                       |
| **Grafana (hosted on GCE)**                  | \$15 (single VM instance)           | \$50 (HA deployment or Managed Grafana)   | GCE instance (\~\$10/month) vs Managed Grafana or 3-node HA setup                                                |
| **Cloud Functions (Auto-recovery triggers)** | \$10 (few invocations)              | \$40 (frequent, aggressive triggers)      | 2 million invocations free; after that \~\$0.40/million + execution time                                         |
| **Cloud Monitoring + Alerts**                | Free Tier or <\$5                   | \$20+                                     | High alert volume increases cost; custom metrics are billed (\~\$0.10/MB)                                        |
| **GKE / Cloud Run (Restart logic)**          | \$30 (basic pod restart)            | \$100+ (autoscaling, HA nodes)            | GKE charges \~\$0.10/hour/node + egress; Cloud Run scales based on concurrency                                   |
