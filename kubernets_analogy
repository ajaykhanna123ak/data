| **Cluster**                          | The **entire restaurant** where all cooking and serving happens.                              | A **group of nodes** managed together. It’s the foundation that hosts your applications.                              |
| **Node**                             | A **kitchen section** (grill, salad, desserts) where chefs work.                              | A **physical or virtual machine** in the cluster where containers run.                                                |
| **Pod**                              | A **chef with their cooking station** preparing one or more dishes.                           | The **smallest deployable unit** in Kubernetes. Runs one or more containers that share resources and network.         |
| **Deployment**                       | The **head chef** who ensures the right number of chefs are cooking and replaces absent ones. | Ensures the desired number of pods are **running and updated**, handling scaling and rollouts automatically.          |
| **Service**                          | The **waiter** delivering dishes to customers, connecting kitchen to dining area.             | Provides a **stable endpoint** (IP/name) to access pods, even if pods come and go. Handles **load balancing**.        |
| **Namespace**                        | **Separate dining rooms** for different groups of customers.                                  | **Logical separation** within a cluster to manage resources, permissions, and isolation for different teams/projects. |
| **Autoscaler**                       | Bringing in **extra chefs** during peak hours and sending some home when it’s slow.           | Automatically **scales pods or nodes** based on traffic or resource usage.                                            |
| **ConfigMap**                        | **Recipe cards** that chefs refer to for cooking instructions.                                | Stores **configuration data** separately from code so pods can consume it dynamically.                                |
| **Secret**                           | **Password-protected recipe or safe** for sensitive ingredients.                              | Stores **sensitive data** like passwords, tokens, or keys safely for pods.                                            |
| **Ingress**                          | The **main restaurant entrance / host** guiding orders to the correct kitchen.                | Manages **external access** to services, routing HTTP/HTTPS traffic to the right pods.                                |
| **PersistentVolume**                 | **Pantry or fridge** where ingredients are stored for long-term use.                          | Provides **persistent storage** that exists beyond the lifecycle of a pod.                                            |
| **PersistentVolumeClaim**            | **Chef asking for ingredients** from the pantry/fridge.                                       | Pods request storage via a **PVC**, which binds to a PersistentVolume.                                                |
| **ReplicaSet**                       | **Assistant chef team** making sure there are always X chefs working on a dish.               | Ensures the **exact number of pod replicas** are running. Often managed by deployments.                               |
| **Job**                              | **Special order or catering event** that needs to be done once.                               | Runs a **pod/task to completion** rather than continuously.                                                           |
| **CronJob**                          | **Daily breakfast prep or scheduled special dish**.                                           | Runs **tasks on a schedule**.                                                                                         |
| **ClusterRole & Role**               | **Restaurant rules for who can access which kitchen section**.                                | Manages **permissions** for resources in a cluster or namespace.                                                      |
| **ClusterRoleBinding & RoleBinding** | **Assigning specific chefs or staff to roles** in the restaurant.                             | Grants **users/service accounts** access to resources per Role/ClusterRole.                                           |
| **Fleet / Multi-Cluster**            | **A chain of restaurants** coordinated by the same headquarters.                              | Manages **multiple clusters centrally**, allowing deployment and policy across clusters.                              |
