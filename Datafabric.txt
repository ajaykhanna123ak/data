2. How to Use Data Fabric to Access ServiceNow API

Understanding ServiceNow API:

ServiceNow provides REST APIs (e.g., /api/now/table/incident).

Requirements: Instance URL, credentials (Basic Auth/OAuth), API endpoint.


Integration Approach:

Use the REST API as a custom data source.

Set up authentication and API requests.

Create pipelines/data flows to extract, transform, and load (ETL) ServiceNow data.

Manage governance and access control.

Optionally automate workflows for two-way synchronization.


Steps to Configure:

Set up authentication.

Test APIs (using Postman/cURL).

Connect via your Data Fabric platform (using REST connectors or custom integrations).

Map and transform incoming ServiceNow data.

Catalog and govern the data assets.
